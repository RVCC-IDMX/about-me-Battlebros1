There were tons of things that I learned while making this. There was not much that I did know before starting all of this. Each section of this project showed me something new and something different that I could do for my web page. I also did not realize how many things go into making sure that your website works on different sized devices. I thought it just worked itself out. I did not know how much work goes into trying to make your website accessible for everyone. Like making all the colors not clash with one another or have text that can be read on the background that it is on. Everything that was put into this project was a new skill that I learned and something that I could use in the future. Each section had something new to show me and something that I did not know that's how it worked. This was overall a fun experience and I learned some great things along the way that I could hopefully use in the future.

The Major Colors used are 
Hex: #caf564 RGB: rgba(202,245,100,255) which is the main background color. 
Hex: #66dece RGB: rgba(102,222,206,255) which is the box around avatar background.
Hex: #333333 RGB: rgba(51,51,51,255) which is the top nav bar.
Hex: #000000 RGB: rgba(0,0,0,255) which is all the text.
