            <h2>Biography:</h2>

            <div>

                <p>I am someone that likes to hang out with friends and play games. I am a tall fella at 6’1. I always try to look on the bright side of things. I would say that I am a funny guy and that I can make people laugh. I have a younger brother by three years and he seems to have everything under control. But I, on the other hand, very much do not. But we just keep pushing forward and try to go on with our lives trying to make the most of it even when things seem bleak. I had 4 cats but we had to put one down because she was not doing well and not getting better. I am doing my best to push on and only remember the best thing about her. Things are tough but we must push on and try and look at the bright side of things.</p>

                    <p>
                        When I was looking for something to add to this project I really did not know what I wanted or how I would go about doing it. 
                        So I started looking at different effects that I could add and see how I would be able to implement it into my website. 
                        I started with maybe I could add a simple animation to something both the more I thought about it the more I was like what would I animate and for what purpose would it have. 
                        I did learn how to animate something by adding keyframes. I could get something to change color or have it move around. Not too crazy stuff but still looked cool I just could not find a use for it. 
                        So then I went to look for something else I could add that would actually be able to be used somewhere. I finally came to the conclusion that I will add an image hover effect. It’s not too difficult to add and I can actually use it on something. 
                        So that what I went and did the images above have a hover effect that gives a little bit more info about the images.
